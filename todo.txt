Plans for stage 2 finishing
Create some buildings costing galactic credits, because recycling systems are broken.
Fix the market always getting way too high by the time it is unlocked
Diplomacy/trade system

double check rocket silo prices
Dump excess cargo if storage full.
matter transported can sometimes send non whole numbers - fix that
fix auto re add trade in market (due to trades expiring not resetting counter)
much larger bonuses for tiering up solar panels in space

update the dumb code parsing system.


pyrome needs to be less reliant on diomine


Thoughts on things left to add for stage2:
Possibly add robot making factories, requiring nanobots.
  takes a huge drain on basic metals and a moderate drain on germanium, but when turned off the robots will produce very large amounts of resource.
After buying enough combat ships unlock the wellspring and wellspring miners, an endless source of frostium
Reasonably price carbon factories and nanobots
Nuclear reactor - require germanium carbon nanotubes and metals. Consumes residual burning core to produce absurd amounts of energy (20B energy per burning core.)
Shadow trawlers - spacecraft requiring high tier pieces and in exchange give very large amounts of shadow.
